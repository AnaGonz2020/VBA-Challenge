# Description

We were tasked in generating subroutines using VBA to analyze stock data over 2018, 2019, and 2020, so that we can gather the Yearly Change, Percent Change, and Total Stock Volume. As a bonus, we were tasked to generate an additional subtroutine so that we can gather the Greatest % Increase, Greatest Percent Decrease, and the Greatest Total Volume.


# Results

After reviewing course notes, as well as countless 'How To' articles online, and tutoring sessions, I was able to generate subroutines that ran through the stock data provided the requested information. In generating this with VBA, it made the tedious job of analyzing the data once for all 3 worksheets. The Yearly Change is also formatted to show in Green when the change is Positive, and for to show in Red if the the change is Negative. 

All of the data that is collected, was also generated in a Summary Table so that the information can be found quickly and be easy to read, and comprehend.

# Comments

Generating the required subroutines was not an easy task for me, however, with the constant support of not just my fellow students, but all of the staff and resources we are provided with, I was able to complete the challenge as well as the bonus material. It was definitely an intense Module for me, lots of information and sooo fast paced. BUT! I achieved what I set out to accomplish, on to the NEXT Module!
